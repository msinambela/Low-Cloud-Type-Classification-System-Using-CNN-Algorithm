# Low-cloud-type-classification-system-using-CNN-algorithm
The goal of this research is to develop a system which is able to recognize cloud patterns through imagery to determine the types so that the subjective factor in cloud observations can be decreased and help observers to observe cloud types more easily. This system was built by implementing the Python programming language.
